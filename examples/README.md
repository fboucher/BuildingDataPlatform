# Examples Overview

Use this section to quickly find the example that matches your goal and role.

You will find consumer-focused and provider-focused scenarios, each built as a
small runnable path that validates one concrete outcome.

Across scenarios, the examples demonstrate practical implementation patterns:
environment-based credentials, explicit failure messages, CI-friendly execution,
and scenario-local security and setup guidance.

## Example Pattern

The examples follow a scenario-first pattern:

- Start from a concrete outcome you want to validate.
- Use the smallest script that proves that outcome.
- Fail with explicit, actionable errors when credentials, configuration, or access
  are wrong.
- Keep setup and run guidance inside each scenario folder so details stay local to
  the implementation.

## Conventions Across Examples

- Credentials are loaded from environment variables when a scenario calls an API.
- Scenario scripts terminate with meaningful exit behavior suitable for smoke
  testing and CI.
- Errors are written to identify the failure layer quickly.
- Security notes are documented per scenario in each local `SECURITY.md`.
