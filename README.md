This starter pack gives partners and independent software vendors a practical path to build on the **EcoStruxure&trade; - Building Data Platform** (BDP).

BDP is a cloud platform that stores semantically described building data from Schneider Electric and third-party systems, and exposes that data through REST, GraphQL, and streaming APIs. REST operations are under `/api/`, and GraphQL requests use `/graphql`.

- **Consume data**: REST &middot; GraphQL &middot; Azure Event Hubs (streaming)
- **Provide data**: Use the Data Integration Framework (DIF) over Azure IoT Hub
- **Model semantics**: [Brick Ontology](https://brickschema.org/) (equipment, points) &middot; REC (sites, buildings, levels, rooms) &middot; [QUDT](https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo) (units)
- **Authenticate**: Bearer token &middot; Event Hub connection string &middot; IoT Hub SAS

## Documentation

Use this page as the home page, then use the documentation summary for the full map of guides and workflows.

- Start here: [Setup Credentials](docs/setup-credentials.md)
- Then understand access behavior: [Access Model and Permissions](docs/access-model-and-permissions.md)
- Explore our documentation by starting with [Documentation Summary](docs/README.md)

## Examples

The starter pack includes runnable examples for both consumers (read data) and providers (send data). Each example is self-contained, reads credentials from environment variables when needed, and exits with a meaningful code.

For the full catalog and quick-start guidance, see
[Examples Overview](examples/README.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Time to first query: ~10 minutes**, assuming you have received your welcome email.

## Support

**For permission, access, or data configuration issues:**
Reply to your welcome email, or contact your Schneider Electric representative. Include the environment, the consumer or data source name, the request you made and the response you got, the answer usually depends on configuration only Schneider Electric can see.

**For issues with examples or documentation:**
Please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/SchneiderElectricBuildings/BuildingDataPlatform/issues) with a clear description of the problem, including any error messages or examples of what's unclear.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and for the credential-handling practices every example follows.
