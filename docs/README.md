## Recommended reading order

1. [Setup Credentials](setup-credentials.md)
2. [Access Model and Permissions](access-model-and-permissions.md)
3. [Consuming Data](consuming-data.md) or [Providing Data](providing-data.md), based on your workflow
4. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) when results are unexpected

## Guide-by-guide overview

Table – What each guide gives you
