# Importing an API Collection File

## Goal

Import a BDP API collection file (Postman Collection Format v2.1) into a REST client
so you can send the requests without writing any code.

This page is generic on purpose. Every collection file in `examples/` uses the same
format and the same import flow, no matter which client you use, so this page is
referenced from each of those examples instead of repeating the steps.

## Prerequisites

- A REST client that supports the Postman Collection Format v2.1, for example
  Postman, Insomnia, Bruno, Thunder Client, or Hoppscotch.
- The collection file from the example folder, for example
  `examples/rest-quickstart-postman/bdp-rest-quickstart.json`.
- API token (See [Setup Credentials for API Clients](setup-credentials-api-clients.md))

## Steps

1. Open your client's import screen.

   The action is usually named **Import**. It is commonly available from a toolbar
   button, the File menu, or a workspace-level "+" menu.

2. Select the collection file.

   Point the import dialog at the `.postman_collection.json` file from the example
   folder. Most clients detect the format automatically; you should not need to pick a
   format manually.

3. Confirm the import target.

   Some clients ask which workspace or folder to import into. Choose your personal
   workspace, not a shared/team one, so you do not accidentally share collection
   variables with teammates before you have set your own token.

4. Open the imported collection and locate its variables.

   Each example collection ships with variables for request parameters (for example
   `apiVersion`, paging values). The API host is a literal value inside each request's
   URL, not a variable. The bearer token is not a plain variable either: it is
   referenced from your client's vault, `{{vault:BDP_API_TOKEN}}`. Do not edit the
   committed file to add your token; instead follow
   [Setup Credentials for API Clients](setup-credentials-api-clients.md) to store it in
   your client's secret/vault storage.

5. Send a request.

   Open any request in the collection and send it. If the collection defines a
   collection-level auth (usually **Bearer Token**), every request inherits it
   automatically.

## Expected Outcome

- The collection appears in your client's sidebar with all its requests.
- Collection variables are visible and editable from the collection or environment
  settings.
- Sending a request without the vault secret set produces a `401` from the API, since
  the bearer token resolves to an empty or unresolved value.

## Notes

### Running the whole collection

Most clients include a way to run every request in a collection in sequence and see a
pass/fail summary (Postman calls this the **Runner**; other clients have equivalent
features).


### Keeping the file in the repository unchanged

Treat the imported collection as read-only reference material. If you need different
defaults (a different host, extra requests), fork it into your own workspace rather
than editing the checked-in file, so the example stays a reliable starting point for
the next person.
